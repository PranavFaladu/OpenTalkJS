In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
Trees stand sentinel, their limbs outstretched,
As leaves rustle softly, like lovers' whispered speech.

The wind stirs scents of earth and bloom and decay,
A primal fragrance that awakens the day.
The sun rises high, a fiery blaze,
That lights the world with promise, and dispels the haze.

In woodland depths, where wild things roam and play,
The creatures of the night begin their secret way.
The owl's soft hooting echoes through the trees,
As rabbits and deer dance, beneath the starry breeze.

Rivers flow, like silver threads of old,
Through mountains tall, where eagles soar with tales untold.
Their waters weave a tapestry so fine and deep,
Reflecting all the secrets, in their quiet, peaceful sleep.

The earth itself is witness to it all,
A patient observer, that stands through every fall.
It knows the cycle of birth, growth, decay, and rest,
And holds the memories, of all the seasons' quest.

So let us listen to the whispers of the land,
And learn from nature's wisdom, hand in hand.
For in its ancient heartbeat, we find our own true voice,
A symphony of life, that echoes through our choice.
