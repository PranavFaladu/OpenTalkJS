**Title:** Investigating the Effects of Microplastic Pollution on Soil Microbiome and Plant Growth in Tropical Ecosystems

**Background:** The increasing presence of microplastics in natural environments has raised concerns about their impact on ecosystems. Despite growing interest in this area, there is limited understanding of how microplastics affect soil microbiomes and plant growth.

**Objective:** This study aims to investigate the effects of microplastic pollution on soil microbiome composition and plant growth in tropical ecosystems.

**Methods:** We collected soil samples from three different sites with varying levels of microplastic pollution (low, moderate, and high) in a tropical forest ecosystem. Soil samples were analyzed for microbial community composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, while plant growth parameters were measured using standard laboratory protocols. Microplastics were then removed from the soil samples to simulate their removal.

**Results:** Our results showed that microplastic pollution significantly altered soil microbial community composition, with increased abundance of fungal and bacterial species associated with microplastic exposure. We also observed significant negative effects on plant growth parameters, including reduced shoot length, biomass production, and root development in high-microplastic-exposure soils.

**Conclusion:** This study provides new insights into the impact of microplastic pollution on tropical ecosystems, highlighting the potential risks to soil health and plant growth. Our findings have implications for management strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of microplastics on ecosystem function and biodiversity conservation.
