"Whispers of the Wild"

In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest stirs, its secrets to convey.
A gentle breeze stirs leaves of gold,
As ancient trees stand tall, their stories untold.

The river winds, a silver thread,
Through hills and valleys, where wildflowers spread.
Their petals sway, like ballerinas dance,
In harmony with nature's sweet romance.

The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks aflame, with sunrise light.
The wind whispers secrets, through the trees so tall,
A language known to few, but heard by all.

In forests deep, where creatures roam,
The rustling leaves, a hidden home.
The chirping birds, a symphony sweet,
Echoes of life, in nature's beat.

As sunset falls, and day succumbs to night,
The stars appear, like diamonds bright.
The world is hushed, in peaceful slumber deep,
In nature's arms, our souls do keep.

So let us wander, through this world so grand,
And listen to the whispers of the land.
For in its rhythms, we find our own pace,
A harmony with nature, a sacred space.
