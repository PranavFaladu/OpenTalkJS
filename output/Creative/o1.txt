**Twist:**

As Emilia gets closer to the truth, she discovers that she is actually the daughter of a woman involved in the tragedy, and that her ability to absorb memories has been passed down through generations of women in her family. But there's a catch - each time she absorbs a memory, she loses a fragment of her own identity.
